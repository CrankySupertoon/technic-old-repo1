Regarding the Dolphins:
There are six different kind of dolphins (from common to rare): blue, green, purple, dark, pink and albino. The last two kinds are seen only rarely in the wild. 
Taming dolphins:
You can tame dolphins by feeding them raw fish. the rarer the dolphin, the more raw fish it requires to be tamed. A blue dolphin requires 2 raw fish and an albino dolphin requires 12 raw fish. You can also tame dolphins by riding/breaking them. Rarer dolphins are noticeable faster than common ones. 
Breeding dolphins:
Tamed adult dolphins can breed by feeding them cooked fish and keeping them apart from other creatures in a similar fashion than the horse breeding. Young dolphin can not breed or be tamed/ridden. 
Two dolphins of the same color will always have offspring of such color. Dolphins have a 'genetic value' from 1-6. (blue = 1 and albino = 6)  if you mix and match dolphins you have 1/3 chance of obtaining a purple or dark dolphin if the genetic value addition of the parents is 3 or 4, and you have a 1/10 chance of obtaining a pink or albino dolphin if the genetic value addition equals 5 or 6. i.e. A pink dolphin(5) can be obtained in 1/10 of cases by combining a blue(1) plus a dark(4) dolphin or a green (2) plus a purple (3) dolphin.

Version 2.4
-Added property file, from now onwards, the mod is released as a single package and you can edit the 'MoCreatures.properties' file to add/remove creatures at will
(thanks to czrozi)
the mocreatures.properties file should be copied to the /.minecraft/ folder (where you also find the lastlogin and options.txt files)
By default, the file contains the following:

Horse
Ogre
FireOgre
CaveOgre
Boar
Bear
Duck
LionK
Wolf
PolarBear
Wraith
FlameWraith
Bunny
Bird
Fox
Werewolf

If you want to deactivate mobs, simply open and edit the mocreatures.properties file by changing the name of the mob i.e.:

No FireOgre
FireOgre-
#FireOgre
*FireOgre
fireogre

Any of those changes will deactivate the Fire Ogres.  If you leave an empty line, the mod won't load any of the mobs after that empty line.
The name of the file 'MoCreatures.properties' is case sensitive as well as the name of the mobs. i.e. 'horse' is not the same as 'Horse'.  changing the name to 'horse' will deactivate that mob.

If you don't copy the MoCreatures.properties file to the right place, all the mobs will be loaded by default.

Quick guide on how to breed horses:
Rules for breeding:
-The horses to breed should be kept close (no more than 4 blocks away)
-There should be no other horses around (8 blocks)
-Sterile horses won't bred
-You have to feed them both to start the process (suitable foods are eggs or pumpkins)
-you can not be too close (4 blocks) or they won't breed
-it takes time (about 1/2 minecraft day)
-the results of the breed depends on the genetic 'value' of the horses:
light horses = 1
brown horses = 2
dark horses = 3
unicorns = 4
pegasus = 5
packhorse = 6
nightmare = 7
black pegasus = 8

Depending on the sum of both parents' genetic value you have a chance of getting a rare breed:
-sum equal 7 = chance of getting a packhorse
-sum equals 9 = chance of getting a nightmare
-sum equals 10 = chance of getting a pegasus
-sum equals 12 = chance of getting a black pegasus
-two packhorses won't give birth to a black pegasus
-if the sum is none of the above, you will get a random horse with genetic value 1-5

Quick Guide on How to use the Horses' Inventory:
-You first need to give a chest to the horse. (hold a chest in your hand and right click on the horse). Only Pack horses and Black pegasus will accept chests
-To open the inventory, hold a torch or a shovel in your hand and right click on the horse

Changes in version 1.6.5
-Increased attack range of lioness
-Lioness is more aggressive than the Lion
-Fire Ogres and Flame Wraiths will only spawn in Hard difficulty. Both will also spawn in Hell
-Decreased pyromany of Fire Ogres. They still burn whole forests, tho.
-Added Boars: attack only prey smaller than them (including bunnies!). Boars will also attack you if you get really close.

-Added Horses including Unicorns and Pegasus
-For every horse you find, there is a 3% chance of finding a Unicorn and only a 1% chance of finding a Pegasus... so good luck!
-Added craftable Horse Saddles.  You will require a horse saddle to ride your horse. The normal saddles that you find randomly in dungeons only work for pigs. 

-Quick guide on how to tame horses: The faster/rarer the horse, the harder to tame. This is what they require to be as docile as possible before you mount them. Even after making them happy, you will have to break/ride them until they accept you.  To make them docile you will need to give:
- Light horses (1 bread or 4 wheat)
- Brown Horses (2 bread or 8 wheat)
