----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENT PROBLEMS
Nothing as of right now

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES

Optifine is not compatible because it isn't compatible with Minecraft Forge which Technic makes heavy use of. 
The Aether is not compatible either because it requires a different API that conflicts with everything ever. Why would you want to go there anyway, do you realize how many things you can do now?
Anything that modifies any base class files since this will more than likely break Forge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOW COMPATIBILITIES

Too Many Items (TMI) works, although you might need to get a different patch to make all the parts of RedPower show up


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technic v3 remaines an unoffical release. I do have permission from some of the modders (you know who you are) but for drama avoidance purposes I will not say who, and isntead will maintain that the pack is unofficial.

Build a solar-powered wizard tower, snipe ogres from your ATV, declare holy war on a village to get their oil, time your home with automatic lights, refine bio-fuel from sugarcane and cactus farms to power your matter generators or simply mine the planet bare while you cackle with glee on your RedPower panel chair, protected by laser turrets and force fields.

The mods are all incredible and when they are merged together Minecraft becomes something truly special. Enjoy the finest that the Minecraft modding community has to offer.
