1.7.3 v2
----
- Upgraded to Industrial Craft 2 v1.0, this fixes the strong water current bug and the mining drill not seen as a pickaxe by other mods, among other things. Be careful with that drill when around your machines!
- Upgraded to EE version 3.53
- Upgraded Buildcraft to 2.1.1
- Upgraded to MAtmos 1.7.3 r5
- Included a pre-configured ModLoader.cfg file to hopefully avoid any more conflicts, with both frivolous SDK mod options disabled. I did this in version 1 as well, but I put it in the wrong spot
- Included tweaks for Treecapitator to allow all modded axes in the game to count. This means you can use the chainsaw, bronze axe and dark matter axe and get the treecapitator experience
- A bunch of small tweaks that I've already forgotten about
