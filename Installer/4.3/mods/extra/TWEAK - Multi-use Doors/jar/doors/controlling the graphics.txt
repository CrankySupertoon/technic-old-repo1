All graphics are optional! Delete any or all for the textures from your texture pack listed below to replace them.

Place a .png texture in this folder with exactly the name given below to change what that door type looks like in-game. To use the default one listed on the right, delete that texture.

If you want to use textures for specific texture packs only, add a folder to its .zip called "doors", following this naming template.

The textures with _alt at the end of the name are optional alternates. Delete the other and remove _alt to enable them.
