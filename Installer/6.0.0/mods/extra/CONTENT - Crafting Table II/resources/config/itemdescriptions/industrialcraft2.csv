Cables

item.itemTinCable.*.1,Ultra-low-current-cable,"Tin cables can only tolerate up to 5 EU/t, but are very cheap and have extremely low energy loss. In fact, only 1 EU is lost every 40 blocks—the same loss as diamond wire. However, keep in mind that energy loss is calculated per EU packet, so tin cables actually lose over 100x more energy when carrying the same total EU. These wires cannot be insulated, so they cannot be painted. They are also prone to electrocuting nearby objects, so be careful."

item.itemIronCable.*.1,HV Cable,"HV cables are the highest tier conventional cables. They can tolerate High Voltage (512 EU/s) and Extreme Voltage (2048 EU/s), but have an extremely high distance-related energy loss—1 EU every block! HV cables can have 3 different levels of insulation. Considering that a shock from a poorly insulated HV cable will most likely prove fatal, it is recommended to insulate them well unless the cable is located in a completely unreachable area. Even then, insulation should be applied to reduce the massive energy losses."
item.itemIronCableI.*.1,Insulated HV Cable,Insulted HV Cable is much safer than the uninsulated version and suffers less distance-related energy loss. (~1 EU every 1.05 blocks) The insulation level on this cable is the lowest that it can be.

tile.blockITNT.*.1,Industrial TNT,"Did anyone yet notice that mining can be grey, plain and boring, even with a Mining Drill? Now, of course it is, because it's still hard work and a hell of a lot of stone to mine through. Some people claim TNT-mining to be far more fun; and for sure it is. On the downside however, using TNT to mine stuff reduces your overall mineral gain by 70% due to explosion casualties, not to mention the extreme danger of working with explosives... For this sole reason, we invented industrial TNT.

Splitting up the charges and adding some nice cutting material results in the explosion caused by our patented ITNT to be much more useful: It has less direct power, which means no more accidental suicides or destroyed ore. "

tile.blockFenceIron.*.1,Iron Fence,"The Iron Fence can serve as a normal fence, but its primary function is to replace the function of ladders. Iron Fences can be stacked on top of one another, and if a player approaches the resulting pole while holding the Crouch button, he will quickly slide down the pole, much faster than down a ladder, though still not fast enough to receive fall damage upon touching the ground.

Furthermore, if powered by a Magnetizer, the Iron Fence can serve as a type of elevator, quickly propelling upwards any players with metal shoes equipped who approach it."
,Rubber Trampoline,"The rubber trampoline is a highly advanced piece of rubber capable of doing one amazing thing: Bouncing you!  Jumping off of a height onto this rubberized sheet will cause you to bounce back up, effectivly negating fall damage while having fun!

Be warned, the rubber sheet will not prevent injury from a very high fall! (approximately 11 blocks.)

The rubber trampoline must be connected on at least 2 sides to blocks on the same level as it, and must have a gap underneath, similar to a real trampoline."
