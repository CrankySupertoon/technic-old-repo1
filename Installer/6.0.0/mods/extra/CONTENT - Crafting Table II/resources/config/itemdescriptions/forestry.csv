tile.planter.2.1,Rubber Plantation
tile.planter.0.1,Arboretum
tile.harvester.3.1,Pumpkin Harvester,A logger that has been specialized to harvest pumpkins and/or melons in a pumpkin farm when powered by a Buildcraft compatible engine.
tile.machine.0.1,Fermenter,"A Fermenter is a specially designed machine capable of taking a fertilizing agent (manure or fertilizer), a supply of water, and plant materials and producing liquid biomass. In order to ferment the plant materials to produce biomass the Fermenter must have a constant supply of water and be powered by a Buildcraft compatible engine. This biomass may be used as an effective alternative fuel in Biogas Engines. Biomass may either be piped out via Buildcraft pipes or placed into empty cans. Biomass may find additional uses when converted to biofuel via a Still. Plant materials accepted are :saplings, cactus, sugarcane, mushrooms, and wheat, with saplings being the most effective fuel. A single constantly running Fermenter can typically power up to 3 Biogas Engines."
tile.mill.1.1,Rainmaker,"An advanced machine capable of actually altering the weather, the Rainmaker is used when farms are suffering severe droughts. When fed an Iodine Capsule, the Rainmaker will being to charge. When it is completed charging, the Rainmaker will cause a shift in weather and it will begin to rain. Very useful for supplying Raintanks. The Rainmaker may be fed an Iodine Capsule by right clicking while holding the capsule or by piping one in during an inactive period, if a Rainmaker is already charging the capsule will be rejected."
tile.harvester.0.1,Logger,"The second and final machine necessary for the completion of an automatic tree farm, the Logger will search for adult trees in an area slightly larger than the Arboretum (to compensate for offset placement) and will chop them down. The Logger will also collect the wood and saplings that the tree drops. The harvest is stored in a small, inaccessible inventory but may be piped out using Buildcraft pipes or otherwise automatically stored in any adjacent chests. If using pipes, the top and bottom of the Logger will eject saplings, while the sides will eject collected wood. The Logger does require energy from a Buildcraft compatible engine and the diamonds necessary for construction may also be replaced with industrial diamonds if IC2 is installed. The Logger is also a required component for several other machines that share similar but specialized features. "
tile.harvester.2.1,Rubber Harvester,"A Logger converted to chop down IC2 rubber trees, the Rubber Harvester behaves in much the same way. In addition to a normal Logger's behavior, the Rubber Harvester will also collect any dropped resin that is extracted by an Automatic Treetap. Resin is ejected out of the top or bottom of the Rubber Harvester along with saplings when using pipes."
tile.planter.5.1,Mushroom Farm,"A farming machine capable of producing the spectacles that are giant mushrooms. The Mushroom farm must be supplied with a constant supply of mycelium and mushrooms - either red or brown, it will plant and grow both. Additionally, the Mushroom Farm must also be placed in a low-light setting, as mushrooms tend to grow in darkness, so it must remain at or below light-level 11. When a giant mushroom finally matures, the mycelium is depleted and replaced by dirt. When the giant mushroom is collected, the dirt is collected and replaced by mycelium and a mushroom is replanted. As with all farms, the Mushroom Farm must be powered by a Buildcraft compatible engine."
tile.mill.0.1,Forester,"A costly machine capable of injecting catalyst into the soil of an Arboretum and causing trees to grow nigh instantly, vastly increasing the efficiency of any automatic tree farms it benefits. The Forester must be supplied with a steady stream of catalyst and must be receiving power from a Buildcraft compatible engine in order to function.  "
tile.machine.1.1,Still,"Devilish, hippie biomass got you down? Not to worry, pump it into a Still in order to produce wildly efficient, greenhouse gas producing biofuel. Biofuel may be used to directly power Buildcraft combustion engines, or as a more efficient fuel for Biogas Engines or Bio Power Generators. After all, what harm could it cause? The Still accepts an input of biomass and will output converted biofuel when it - and its connected pipe - receive power from a Buildcraft compatible engine. Additionally, the Still will fill any empty cans with biofuel if placed in its inventory, or biomass cans may be used to refill the internal tank of biomass. The world is a beautiful place.. you've got a lot of work to do."
tile.harvester.4.1,Turbary,An inexpensive machine used to cut mature peat from a Peat Bog when supplied with power from a Buildcraft Compatible engine. 
tile.machine.4.1,Bio Power Generator,"A specialty machine for those suffering from an extreme phobia of liquid power. The Bio Power Generator can accept inputs of either biomass or biofuel and will convert the liquid into a steady stream of IC2 power. The generator has an internal storage of up to 30k EU and can accept cables for transmitting the power. If pipes are undesirable, biomass or biofuel cans may be placed inside the generator to fill its internal reservoir. "
