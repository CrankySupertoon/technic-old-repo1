Xie’s Farming v1.7b by deathrat converted to Forge then to 1.8 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENT PROBLEMS
none


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES


Optifine does odd things to certain items in the game. Buildcraft's oil looks especially odd. Harmless but might break immersion.
Anything that modifies any base class files since this will more than likely break Forge. 
Mods like the Aether are right out and will only end it tears.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOW COMPATIBILITIES


Any Forge-compatible mod should be ok to work with Technic but we're getting low on block id's so any mod that adds 20+ block ids might be hurting to get in
Any mod that doesn't actually add anything to the items/blocks list, things like MC Dungeon work great with a Technic map




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technic v4 remains unoffical. 
Too much drama and hate and not enough playing and enjoying. 
Enjoy the finest that the Minecraft modding community has to offer.
